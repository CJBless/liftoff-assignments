# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

### Overview

“Maintainer” organizes and tracks maintenance data for any vehicle. Within it, multiple vehicles can be added for an individual, a family, or a business to keep track of all their vehicle needs.  It will feature a dashboard calendar view for vehicle owners to quickly see the most relevant event and the events will be filterable by priority or next due.  Owners can add events, set custom notification reminders for a type of event, and view a limited archive of completed events.  This application can be used to organize maintenance on any type of vehicle (eg., cars, motorcycles, boats, aircraft). It can even be adapted for recurring household maintenance needs making it useful for just about everyone. 

We all have many things to take care of and it is easy for people to forget important basic tasks like scheduling an oil change. Some of us have families and need to to keep track of multiple vehicles at once. This app can plan and remind you of when regular maintenance tasks for all your vehicles are due.  “Maintainer” will focus on a set of rules for when something is due, and it will send an alert at a specified time beforehand. For instance, let's say your oil change is due 3 days from now, you can set up an alert to inform you 2 days ahead of time, giving you enough time to set an appointment. The user will be able to see the maintenance history, prioritize their family’s maintenance schedule, and as an administrator, they can assign vehicles to family members and send them reminders for upcoming events.
